In the microchannel\\nthe Taylor line swims at an acute angle along a channel wall with a clearly enhanced swimming speed due\\nto hydrodynamic interactions with the bounding wall. While in a dilute obstacle lattice swimming speed\\nis also enhanced, a dense obstacle lattice gives rise to geometric swimming. This new type of swimming is\\ncharacterized by a drastically increased swimming speed. Since the Taylor line has to ﬁt into the free space\\nof the obstacle lattice, the swimming speed is close to the phase velocity of the bending wave traveling along\\nthe Taylor line. While adjusting its swimming motion within the lattice, the Taylor line chooses a speciﬁc\\nswimming direction, which we classify by a lattice vector. When plotting the swimming velocity versus the\\nmagnitude of the lattice vector, all our data collapse on a single master curve. Finally, we also report more\\ncomplex trajectories within the obstacle lattice.\\nPACS numbers: Valid PACS appear here\\nKeywords: Taylor line, C. elegans, obstacle lattice, microchannel, geometrical swimming\\nI.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nThe motility of microorganisms in their liquid environ-\\nment is important in various biological processes1.

Fu and Thomas R. Powers\\nDivision of Engineering, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912\\nCharles W. Wolgemuth\\nDepartment of Cell Biology, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT 06030\\n(Dated: February 8, 2022)\\nMotivated by the swimming of sperm in the non-Newtonian ﬂuids of the female mammalian repro-\\nductive tract, we examine the swimming of ﬁlaments in the nonlinear viscoelastic Upper Convected\\nMaxwell model. We obtain the swimming velocity and hydrodynamic force exerted on an inﬁnitely\\nlong cylinder with prescribed beating pattern. We use these results to examine the swimming of a\\nsimpliﬁed sliding-ﬁlament model for a sperm ﬂagellum. Viscoelasticity tends to decrease swimming\\nspeed, and changes in the beating patterns due to viscoelasticity can reverse swimming direction.\\nThe physical environment of the cell places severe con-\\nstraints on mechanisms for motility. For example, viscous\\neﬀects dominate inertial eﬀects in water at the scale of a\\nfew microns. Therefore, swimming cells use viscous resis-\\ntance to move, since mechanisms that rely on imparting\\nmomentum to the surrounding ﬂuid, such as waving a\\nrigid oar, do not work [1, 2]. The fundamental princi-\\nples of swimming in the low-Reynolds number regime of\\nsmall-scale, slow ﬂows have been established for many\\nyears [2, 3, 4, 5], yet continue to be an area of active\\nresearch. However, when a sperm cell moves through the\\nviscoelastic mucus of the female mammalian reproductive\\ntract, the theory of swimming in a purely viscous ﬂuid is\\ninapplicable. Observations of sperm show that they are\\nstrongly aﬀected by diﬀerences between viscoelastic and\\nviscous ﬂuids. In particular, the shape of the ﬂagellar\\nbeating pattern as well as swimming trajectories and ve-\\nlocities depend on the properties of the medium [6, 7, 8].\\nThe interplay of medium properties and ﬂagellar motil-\\nity or transport also arises\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\\\"N/A\\\" title=\\\"N/A\\\"/>\\narXiv:cond-mat/0610154v2  [cond-mat.soft]  7 May 2007\\nFloppy sw im m ing: V iscous locom otion ofactuated elastica\\nEric Lauga\\u0003\\nD epartm ent of M athem atics, M assachusetts Institute of Technology,\\n77 M assachusetts Avenue, Cam bridge, M A 02139.\\n(D ated:Septem ber28,2024)\\nA ctuating periodically an elastic \\f lam ent in a viscous liquid generally breaks the constraints of\\nPurcell’s scallop theorem ,resulting in the generation ofa net propulsive force.
